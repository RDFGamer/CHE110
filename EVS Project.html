<u><h2><font color="brown">Website Description:-</u><br></h2></font>
        In this assignment which is known as CA-1 (Continuous Assessment). We are going to focus on renewable energy forecasting in the context of Solar Energy. Solar Energy is a remarkable Resource because it is an environmental and ecosystem friendly, provides unlimited source under the presence of sun light. <br>
        During in this assignment, we will be going into the depth of understanding its uses, methods, functions, advantages, and disadvantages.<br>
Additionally, we will be providing the concept with the help of web application or mobile application that aims to predict the availability of
renewable energy Sources and the primary focus would be Solar energy with the solar panels and surrounding.<br>
Moreover, the the sources which will going to be used, contribute to resonable environmental benefits, comunity and Economic Implications as well as Sustainable development goal of such as Affordable and clean. energy At will generate electricity 
without causing harm to planet and using solar energy resources like solar panels with help in the development of rural area, city or even country when the electricity isn't affordable for every human being in general.<br>

<h2><u><font color="brown">Materials and Methods:-</font></h2></u>

In the process of creating a web-application or mobile application that predicts the availability of renewable energy sources helping for this Sources like Solar energy and wind. <br>One will be following the steps:
<u><h3><font color="brown">Collecting Information:-</h3></font></u>  In the topic of be renewable energy forecasting We will be colllecting Information of recent weather behaviours so that we are able to measure the humidity, wind speed,rainfall,temperature etc.
Secondly, Collecting Information of solar energy including Components to and its Connection of series to make it functional 
><br><h4><i><b>"This information is quite necessary as we have to predict weather, so it can not be a random guess. Using all above mentioned parameters, it is easier to do so."</b></i>
</h4>
<u><h3><font color="brown">Data Analysis of Information:-</font></h3></u> 
After collecting the Information required to create to a data structure to execute. Now, we will be checking the difference between the resources, To find useful information like how much solar power we can make, how it can be stored or transported. 
Now, we got everything from collecting the data. "its' time to Create a User friendly web-application or mobile application to provide the user such interface that they are easily able to predict the solar power, such that it is possible to create energy, with the help of solar panels at particular locations/area.
This will work with special computer programs and design of the web application as it will instruct the user how it is going to be usedwith a very user-friendly application
The calculations and algorithms of energy depending on the the temperature and climate, clouds etc.

        <u><h2><font color="brown">
Expected Outcome :-</u></h2></font>

The expected outcome and web application of making this assignment to lead to Sustainable development and something very useful, that data provide knowledge to the people about the Solar energy so they can get the live-web analysis with the prediction
Creating the web-application will make people aim to help and provide knowledge, the benefits, uses and aim to make our environment cleaner, to make better World of living, raise awareness eco-friendly and affordable to all.

<font color="brown"><h2><u>Conclusion:-</font></h2></u>
The project involved several key steps to create a comprehensive platform to predict Solar energy availability. The team begin with research and information gathering deliving into the working of solar panels and the impact of feather on energy production that analysis and connections between weather conditions and solar powerÂ generation
